# Hello Hackers
## Intro To Commands:
For the first challenge I connected my ssh to the server and then executed the 'hello' command and got a flag!

     Connected!                                                                        
     hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
     Success! Here is your flag:
     pwn.college{E2_yQUPi49T95s8e_I5tIuXWxKJ.ddjNyUDL4ETO0czW}

## Intro to Arguments:
For the intro to arguments we input into a command and its arguments.

The first word is the command, and the subsequent words are arguments.

      Connected!                                                                        
      hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
      Success! Here is your flag:
      pwn.college{MtCDLNvU2oWugCZX9sryg83qWN6.dhjNyUDL4ETO0czW}
